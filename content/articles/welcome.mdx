Starting therapy can bring up a mix of curiosity and nerves. In our first sessions, we will focus on understanding what matters most to you, what feels hard right now, and how we can work together.

## What to expect

- Collaborative goalâ€‘setting
- A gentle pace that respects your boundaries
- Practical tools you can try between sessions

If you have questions before booking, feel free to reach out.

CBT suggests that our interpretations of events influence how we feel and what we do. By noticing automatic thoughts and experimenting with new behaviors, we can gradually change unhelpful patterns.

### Core ideas

- Situations → Thoughts → Feelings → Behaviors
- Identify and reframe common thinking traps
- Practice exposure and behavioral activation
